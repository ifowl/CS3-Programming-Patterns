# Mediator Flyweight ATC, Keyed Registry
### Description
Part one: Mediator and Flyweight design patterns. Existing air traffic control code was modified to use flyweight class to print airline name in capital letters. The same
logo instance is shared amongst multiple flights of the same Airline name.

Part two: Observer design pattern. Existing Observer code using an Event Registry was modified to use strings as the key for each subject instead of pointers.

Usage: ./AirTrafficControl.out or ./ObserverRegistry.out
