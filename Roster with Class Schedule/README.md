# Roster with Class Schedule
### Description
This is an implementation of the list container using both procedural programming and object-oriented programming (roster.cpp and rosterObject.cpp respectively). The
program takes file names as input and will display classes that each student is a member of, as well as excluding any dropouts.

Format: ./roster.out (class file) (class file) ... (dropouts file)
Note: File containing dropouts must be the last argument.
