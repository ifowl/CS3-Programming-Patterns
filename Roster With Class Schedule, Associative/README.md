# Roster with Class Schedule
### Description
This is an implementation of associative conatiners using a map and a set (rosterMap.cpp and rosterSet.cpp respectively). rosterMap takes file names as input and will 
display classes that each student is a member of, as well as excluding any dropouts. rosterSet will only display student names.

Format: ./map.out (class file) (class file) ... (dropouts file)
or ./set.out (class file) (class file) ... (dropouts file)
Note: File containing dropouts must be the last argument.
